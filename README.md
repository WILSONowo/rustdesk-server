## How to build manually

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Three executables will be generated in target/release.

- hbbs - RustDesk ID/Rendezvous server
- hbbr - RustDesk relay server
- rustdesk-utils - RustDesk CLI utilities

You can find updated binaries on the [Releases](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server/releases) page.

If you want extra features, [RustDesk Server Pro](https://rustdesk.com/pricing.html) might suit you better.

If you want to develop your own server, [rustdesk-server-demo](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server-demo) might be a better and simpler start for you than this repo.
